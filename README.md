# OSM_Processing
Simple OSM processing App

It is a base application from my university project, processing osm.pbf files and creating a graph structure for further analysis from it.
Firstly objects will be stored in custom classes (MapObject, MapWay), then recalculated and stored in OSMNode, OSMEdge entities.
